# Online Bookstore SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This SQL project involves analyzing an online bookstore's database using SQL queries. The dataset includes three CSV files: `Books.csv`, `Customers.csv`, and `Orders.csv`, all of which share at least one common column for relational operations.

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Books.csv** - Contains details of books such as Book\_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Published Year, Price, and Stock.
- **Customers.csv** - Contains customer information including Customer\_ID, Name, Email, Country, and City.
- **Orders.csv** - Stores order details like Order\_ID, Customer\_ID, Book\_ID, Quantity, Order\_Date, and Total\_Amount.

## 🎯 Objectives

The project aims to:

- Perform basic SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- Execute advanced SQL queries for insights into book sales and customer behavior.
- Demonstrate SQL proficiency in handling relational data.
